*kudos to:*
- Jake: youtube:[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9zlE3t8Ko][Docker Compose in 12 Minutes]]

*Quick Gotchas*
  - working with sinatra: 
    don't forget to bind it to 0.0.0.0 as:
    #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
        set :bind, '0.0.0.0'
    #+END_SRC

  - to let ~docker-compose use 80~, elivate its capability
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `which docker-compose`
    #+END_SRC
